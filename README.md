# InstaKilo

Simple example application in objective-c that shows some pictures in a collection view controller (with a panning and zooming detail page) which are sorted by a location property or by a subject property (in the example both properties are simply randomized)

Additionaly switches collection view layouts when device is rotated to a custom build layout made to emulate the apple "cover flow"
